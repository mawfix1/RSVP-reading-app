This was just a simple project for me to learn the basics of Javascript and mess around with HTML/CSS. Was pretty fun to make and I ended up adding everything I sought out to add, so im pretty happy with it.
If I were to add anything more it would probably be a document reading function or a highlighting function to show the user where they are in their text.

Thats pretty much all. When it comes to the actual use of RSVP learning its pretty varied and while some studies show that comprehension is actually better than normal reading, other studies show that its worse. Overall its not for me but was just something fun to make.
